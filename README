This package is intended to allow automatic spacing out of
the lines of an array.  People often complain about text touching the
\hline of a tabular when it is too high or too deep.  For example (with
the amsmath package) a \dfrac{1}{2} surrounded by \hlines touches the
horizontal rules.  This package provides a modifier S to usual column
types (l, c, r, p, m, and b) that ensures a minimal spacing between rules
and cells of an array.

v1.6: New feature as suggested by Bastien Roucaries: an option [math]
      has been introduced, which allows to use cellspace's features into
      matrix environments.

v1.7: New features as suggested by Bastien Roucaries: (1) Possibility
      to change the name of the column used for spacing; (2) Make the
      math column independent of the colum name.

v1.8.1: Package becomes aware of the latest modifications of the array
      package.  Also the GitHub project is referenced in the documentation.

v1.9.0: The new implementation solves a problem with empty
      cells for paragraph-type columns (m, p, b) by
      testing whether \prevdepth is greater than 1000~pt.
      The package has now been made aware of the new
      implementation of \@endpbox of array.
