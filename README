This package is intended to allow automatic spacing out of
the lines of an array.  People often complain about text touching the
\hline of a tabular when it is too high or too deep.  For example (with
the amsmath package) a \dfrac{1}{2} surrounded by \hlines touches the
horizontal rules.  This package provides a modifier S to usual column
types (l, c, r, p, m, and b) that ensures a minimal spacing between rules
and cells of an array.

v1.6: New feature as suggested by Bastien Roucaries - an option [math]
has been introduced, which allows to use cellspace's features into
matrix environments.
